# Simulator Overview

**Authors**: Ethan McAleavy, Steven Darbie, Roman Lynch

This simulator, built in Java, allows users to simulate elastic and inelastic collisions, orbits, and gravitational influence on systems. The simulator implements a Java Swing based GUI, and its functionality is displayed in the video below.

The simulator also implements several different environments, such as Earth, Mars, Venus, etc. This allows users to run physics simulations in gravitational environments other than Earth.
